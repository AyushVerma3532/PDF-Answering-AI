      "Answer:   After this stop we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve days, living very  sparing on our provisions, which began to abate very much, and going no oftener into the  shore than we were obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to make the river  Gambia or Senegal — that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de Verde — where I was in  hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to  take, but to seek out for the lands, or perish there among the negroes. I knew that all the ships  from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the East Indies,  made this cape, or those islands; and in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this single  point, either that I must meet with some ship, or must perish.  When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have said, I began to see that  the land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon  the shore to look at us; we could also perceive they were quite black, and stark naked. I was  once inclined to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to  me. “No go, no go.” However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and I  found they ran along the shore by me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in their  hands, except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they  would throw them a great way with good aim. So I kept a distance, but talked with them by  signs as well as I could, and particularly made signs for something to eat; they beckoned to  me to stop my boat, and that they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the top of  my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour  came back, and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the  produce of their country; but we neither knew what the one or the other was. However, we  were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next dispute, for I was not for  venturing on shore to them, and they were as much afraid to us; but they took a safe way for  us all, for they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off till  we fetched it on board, and then came close to us again.  We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them amends. But an  opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully; for while we were lying by  the shore came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury  from the mountains towards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, or whether  they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was  usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter; because in the first place, those ravenous  creatures seldom appear but in the night; and in the second place, we found the people  terribly frightened, especially the women. The man that had the lance or dart did not fly from  them, but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they did not  seem to offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam  about, as if they had come for their diversion. At last, one of them began to come nearer our  boat than at first I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all possible  expedition, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I  fired, and shot him directly into the head; immediately he sunk down into the water, but rose  instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed he was. He  immediately made to the shore; but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the  strangling of the water, he died just before he reached the shore.  It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures, at the noise and the fire  of my gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the very  terror. But when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to  them to come to the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, and began to search for the  creature. I found him by his blood staining the water: and by the help of a rope, which I slung  round him, and gave the negroes to haul, they dragged him on the shore, and found that it was  a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the negroes held up  their hands with admiration, to think what it was I had killed him with.  The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the gun, swam on shore,  and ran directly to the mountains from whence they came; nor could I, at that distance, know  what it was. I found quickly the negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, so I was  willing to have them take it as a favor from me; which, when I made signs to them that they  might take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with him; and  though they had no knife yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as  readily, and much more readily, than we could have done it with a knife. They offered me  some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would give it them, but made signs for the  skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their provision,  which, though I did not understand, yet I accepted. Then I made signs to them for some  water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that it was  empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. The called immediately to some of their friends,  and there came two women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I  suppose, in the sun; this they set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my  jars, and filled them all three. There women were as stark naked as the men.  I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and leaving my friendly  negroes, I made forward for about eleven days more, without offering to go near the shore,  till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five  leagues before me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing, to make this point. At  length, doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on the other  side, to seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de  Verde, and those the islands, called from thence Cape de Verde Islands. However, they were  at a great distance, and I could not well tell what I had best to do; for if I should be taken with  a fresh of wind, I might neither reach one or other.  In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury  having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out, “Master, master, a ship with a sail!”  and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his  master’s ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I  jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but what she was, viz., that  it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea, for negroes.  But when I observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound some  other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the shore; upon which I stretched out to  sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them, if possible.  With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in their way, but they  would be gone by before I could make any signal to them; but after I had crowded to the  utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their perspective glasses,  and that it was some European boat, which, as they supposed, must belong to some ship that  was lost, so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with this; and as I had  my patron’s ancient on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and fired a  gun both of which they say; for they told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear  the gun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in about three  hours’ time I came up with them.  They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French, but I understood  none of them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered him,  and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors,  at Sallee. Then they bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my goods.  It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one will believe, that I was thus delivered, as I  esteemed it, from such a miserable, and almost hopeless, condition as I was in; and I  immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance. But he  generously told me he would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be delivered safe  to me when I came to the Brazils. “For,” says he, “I have saved your life on no other terms  than I would be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken  up in the same condition. Besides,” says he, “when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way  from your own country, if I should take from you what you have, you will be starved there,  and then I only take away that life I have given. No, no, Seignior Inglese,” says he, “Mr.  Englishman, I will carry you thither in charity, and those things will help you to buy your  subsistence there, and your passage home again.”  As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in the performance to a tittle; for he  ordered the seamen that none should offer to touch anything I had; then he took everything  into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might have  them, even so much as my three earthen jars.  As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for  the ship’s use, and asked me what I would have for it? I told him he had been so generous to  me in everything, that I could not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to  him; upon which he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay me eighty pieces of  eight for it at Brazil, and when it came there, if any one offered to give more, he would make  it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of eight for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not  that I was not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor boy’s  liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However, when I let him  know my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the  boy an obligation to set him free in ten years if he turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury  saying he was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.  We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All  Saints’ Bay, in about twenty-one days after. And now I was once more delivered from the  most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was now to  consider.  The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough remember. He would take  nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard’s skin, and forty for the  lion’s skin, which I had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually  delivered me; and what I was willing to sell he bought, such as the case of bottles, two of my  guns, and a piece of the lump of beeswax, — for I had made candles of the rest; in a word, I  made about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went on shore in the  Brazils.  I had not been long here, but being recommended to the house of a good honest man like  himself, who had an ingeino as they call it, that is, a plantation and a sugar-house, I lived with  him some time, and acquainted myself by that means with the manner of their planting and  making of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I  resolved, if I could get license to settle there, I would turn planter among them, resolving in  the meantime to find out some way to get my money which I had left in London remitted to  me. To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land that  was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement,  and such a one as might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from  England.  I had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of English parents, whose name was  Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbor, because his  plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably together. My stock was but low, as  well as his; and we rather planted for food than anything else, for about two years. However,  we began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so that the third year we planted  some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the  year to come. But we both wanted help; and now I found, more than before, I had done  wrong in parting with my boy Xury.  But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right was no great wonder. I had no remedy but to  go on. I was gotten into an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to  the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father’s house, and broke through all his  good advice; nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life,  which my father advised me to before; and which if I resolved to go on with, I might as well  have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as I had done. And I used  often to say to myself I could have done this as well in England among my friends, as have  gone 5,000 miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a  distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me.  In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret. I had nobody to  converse with, but now and then this neighbor; no work to be done, but by the labor of my  hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had  nobody there but himself. But how just has it been! and how should all men reflect, that when  they compare their present conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to  make the exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity by their experience; — I say,  how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in an island of mere desolation  should be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in  which, had I continued, I had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.  I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation before my kind  friend, the captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship remained there  in providing his loading, and preparing for his voyage, near three months; when telling him  what little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:  “Seignior Inglese,” says he, for so he always called me, “if you will give me letters, and a  procuration here in form to me, with orders to the person who has your money in London to  send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are proper  for this country, I will bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my return. But since  human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders but for  one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for  the first; so that if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry, you  may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply.”  This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not but be convinced it  was the best course I could take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with  whom I left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired.  I wrote the English captain’s widow a full account of all my adventures; my slavery, escape,  and how I had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of his behavior, and in what  condition I was now in, with all necessary directions for my supply. And when this honest  captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants there, to send  over not the order only, but a full account of my story to a merchant at London, who  represented it effectually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered the money, but out of her  own pocket sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present for his humanity and charity to  me.  The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in English goods, such as the captain  had writ for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the  Brazils; among which, without my direction (for I was too young in my business to think of  them), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my  plantation, and which were of great use to me.  When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and  my good steward, the captain, had laid out the five pounds, which my friend had sent him for  a present for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant under bond for six years’  service, and would not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would  have him accept, being of my own produce.  Neither was this all; but my goods being all English manufactures such as cloth, stuffs, baise,  and things particularly valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell them to a  very great advantage; so that I may say I had more than four times the value of my first cargo,  and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbor, I mean in the advancement of my  plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, and a European servant also; I  mean another besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.  But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our greatest adversity, so was  it with me. I went on the next year with great success in my plantation. I raised fifty great  rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my  neighbors; and these fifty rolls, being each of a hundredweight, were well cured, and laid by  against the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now, increasing in business and in wealth,  my head began to be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach, such as are, indeed,  often the ruin of the best heads in business.  Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all the happy things to have yet  befallen me for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and of which  he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of. But other things attended  me, and I was still to be the willful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly to increase  my fault and double the reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should have  leisure to make. All these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to  my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination in contradiction to  the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and  those measures of life, which Nature and Providence concurred to present me with, and to  make my duty.  As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so I could not be content  now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and thriving man in my  new plantation, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of  the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery  that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the  world.  To come, then, by the just degrees to the particulars of this part of my story. You may  suppose, that having now lived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and  prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted  acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at St.  Salvador, which was our port, and that in my discourses among them I had frequently given  them an account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the  negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles — such as beads,  toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like — not only gold-dust, Guinea  grains, elephants’ teeth, etc. but negroes, for the service of the Brazils in great numbers.  They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads, but especially to that  part which related to the buying negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not only not far  entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on by the assiento, or permission, of the  Kings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public, so that few negroes were brought,  and those excessive dear.  It happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and  talking of those things very earnestly, three of them came to ne the next morning, and told me  they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of, the last night, and  they came to make a secret proposal to me. And after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that  they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as I, and  were straitened for nothing so much as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be  carried on because they could not publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so they  desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and divide them  among their own plantations; and, in a word, the question was, whether I would go their  supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered  me that I should have my equal share of the negroes without providing any part of the stock.  This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to any one that had not a  settlement and plantation of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be  very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was thus entered and  established, and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and  to have sent for the other hundred pounds from England; and who, in that time, and with that  little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling,  and that increasing too — for me to think of such a voyage, was the most preposterous thing  that ever man, in such circumstances, could be guilty of.  But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the offer than I could  restrain my first rambling designs, when my father’s good counsel was lost upon me. In a  word, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look after my  plantation in my absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I miscarried.  This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants to do so; and I made a  formal will disposing of my plantation and effect, in case of my death; making the captain of  the ship that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of  my effects as I had directed in my will; one-half of the produce being to himself, and the  other to be shipped to England.  In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects and keep up my plantation. Had I  used half as much prudence to have looked into my own interest, and have made a judgment  of what I ought to have done and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so  prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the probably views of a thriving circumstance, and  gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say nothing of the  reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself.  But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather than my reason. And  accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done as by  agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the (first) of  (September, 1659), being the same day eight year that I went from my father and mother at  Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own interest.  Our ship was about 120 tons burthen, carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master,  his boy, and myself. We had on board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit  for our trade with the negroes — such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles,  especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like.  The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the northward upon our own  coast, with design to stretch over for the African coast, when they came about 10 or 12  degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of their course in those days.  We had very good weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came  the height of Cape St. Augustino, from whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of  land, and steered as if we was bound for the Isle Fernando de Noronha, holding our course  NE. by N., and leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed the line in about  twelve days’ time, and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees 22 minutes northern  latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began  from the south-east, came about to the north-west, and then settled into the north-east, from  whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing  but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us wherever fate and the fury of the winds  directed; and during these twelve days I need not say that I expected every day to be  swallowed up, nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives.  In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our men died of the calenture,  and one man and the boy washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abating a  little, the master made an observation as well as he could, and found that he was in about 11  degrees north latitude, but that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St.  Augustino; so that he found he was gotten upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of  Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward that of the River Orinoco, commonly called the  Great River, and began to consult with me what course he should take, for the ship was leaky  and very much disabled, and he was going directly back to the coast of Brazil.  I was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the sea-coast of America with  him, we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came  within the circle of the Caribbee Islands, and, therefore, resolved to stand away for  Barbadoes, which by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we  might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days’ sail; whereas we could not possibly  make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship and to  ourselves.  With this design we changed our course, and steered away NW. by W. in order to reach some  of our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise determined;  for being in the latitude of 12 degrees 18 minutes, a second storm came upon us which  carried us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way of  all human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger  of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country.  In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early in the morning cried  out, “Land!” and we had no sooner ran out of the cabin to look out, in the hopes of seeing  whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her  motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we  should all have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven into our close  quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea.  It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like condition, to describe or conceive the  consternation of men in such circumstances. We knew nothing where we were, or upon what  land it was we were driven, whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not  inhabited; and as the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at first, we could  not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless  the winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking one  upon another, and expecting death every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as  preparing for another world; for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this. That  which was our present comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our  expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate.  Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon  the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition  indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a  boat at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing against the ship’s  rudder, and in the next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or was driven off to sea, so  there was no hope from her; we had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea,  was a doubtful thing. However, there was no room to debate, for we fancied the ship would  break to pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually broken already.  In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat, and with the help of the rest of  the men they got her slung over the ship’s side; and getting all into her, let go, and committed  ourselves, being eleven in number, to God’s mercy, and the wild sea; for though the storm  was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and might well be  called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.  And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we all saw plainly that the sea went so high,  that the boat could not live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we  had none; nor, if we had, could we have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar  towards the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution, for we all knew that  when the boat came nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach  of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the  wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling  as well as we could towards land.  What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we knew not; the only  hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of expectation was, if we might happen  into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run  our boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was  nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more  frightful than the sea.  After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging  wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de grace.  In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once; and separating us, as  well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, “O God!” for we were  all swallowed up in a moment.  Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I sunk into the water; for  though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath,  till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and  having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the  water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself  nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavored to make on towards  the land as fast as I could, before another wave should return and take me up again. But I  soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great  hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to contend with. My  business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so, by  swimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible: my  greatest concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards the shore  when it came on, might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.  The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 20 or 30 feet deep in its own body,  and I could feel myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very  great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might.  I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to my  immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water; and  though it was not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly,  gave me breath and new courage. I was covered again with water a good while, but not so  long but I held it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck  forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few  moments to recover breath, and till the water went from me, and then took to my heels and  ran with what strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither would this deliver me from  the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again, and twice more I was lifted up by  the waves and carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.  The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me; for the sea, having hurried me  along as before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such  force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow  taking my side and breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body; and had it  returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water. But I recovered a little  before the return of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I  resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave  went back. Now, as the waves were not so high as at first, being near land, I held my hold till  the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore, that the  next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away, and  the next run I took I got to the mainland, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the  cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite out of the  reach of the water.  I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God that my life was  saved in a case wherein there was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe it  is impossible to express to the life what the ecstacies and transports of the soul are when it is  so saved, as I may say, out of the very grave; and do not wonder now at the custom, viz., that  when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned  off, and has a reprieve brought to him — I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with  it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the  animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him:  “For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.”  I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up  in the contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand gestures and motions which I  cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that there should  not be one soul saved by myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of  them except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows.  I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and froth of the sea being so big, I  could hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on  shore?  After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I began to look round  me to see what kind of place I was in, and what was next to be done, and I soon found my  comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes  to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither did I see any prospect  before me but that of perishing with hunger, of being devoured by wild beasts; and that which  was particularly afflicting to me was that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature  for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me  for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco  in a box. This was all my provision; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a  while I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to  consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at  night they always come abroad for their prey.  All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was to get up into a thick bushy tree  like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider  the next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a  furlong from the shore to see if I could find my fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great  joy; having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree,  and getting up into it, endeavored to place myself so as that if I should sleep I might not fall;  and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging, and  having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few  could have done in my condition, and found myself the most refreshed with it that I think I  ever was on such an occasion. \n"
